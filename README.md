# Intense pure air connect API client

This is a Python client to control your air purifier through the cloud API.

Made to replace the android app: `com.groupeseb.airpurifier`.

You can set the mode, the light and the power of your purifier.

Tested with the Rowenta "intense pure air connect" model (PU4080F0), probably compatible with similar models.
